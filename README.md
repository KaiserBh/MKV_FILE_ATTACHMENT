# MKV_FILE_ATTACHMENT
Attaches multiple fonts to mkv file that has the same name as the MKV file.


Put the Mkv files inside the **mkvfiles** folder then put all of the fonts inside a folder can be anything as long it's inside the **mkvfiles folder** then just make sure that the file name and the font's name is the same as the mkv file.

for example 8 fonts that you want to attach to the first mkv 
the Mkv is called **Boku No pico.mkv** , and then for the **fonts** that you want it to go with the **Boku No pico.mkv** must be the same so you would name the fonts as 
**Boku No pico.ttf**
**Boku No pico.otf**
etc. they execute the python file.

I know the instruction is basic and might not make sense so will update it when i got time. 
The script is really basic fyi.
