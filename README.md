# MKV_FILE_ATTACHMENT
Attaches multiple fonts to mkv file that has the same name as the MKV file.


Put the Mkv files inside the **mkvfiles** folder then put all of the fonts inside a folder and make sure the folder of the fonts matches the MKV file name that you want to add/attach.

for example 8 fonts that you want to attach to the first mkv 
the Mkv is called **01_Boku No pico.mkv** , and then for the **parent folder of the fonts** that you want it to go with the **Boku No pico.mkv** must be the same so you would name the **parent folder of the mkv as 
**01_Boku No pico** this will have the fonts for the first mkv file.

I know the instruction is basic and might not make sense so will update it when i got time. 
The script is really basic fyi.
